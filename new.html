<h1>Computer Science HW 6B</h1>
<h2>Chase Dabo</h2>
<p>This is Computer Science HW 6B. It involves taking some plain text and marking it up with
HTML tags to make it display in a browser as a webpage. Follow the instructions below to learn
specifically what you should do for this assignment.<p>
  <ol>
<li>1. Copy the entire contents shown here into a text file in a text editor.<li>
<li>2. Enclose the first line of the file in a heading tag.<li>
<li>3. Replace the second line with your actual name.<li>
<li>4. Enclose the second line of the file in a sub-heading tag.<li>
<li>5. Put the paragraph above this list into a paragraph tag.<li>
<li>6. Put the numbered items in this list into a numbered list.<li>
<li>7. Put the paragraph below this list of items into a paragraph tag.<li>
<li>8. Save your document as CS_HW_6B.html and display it in your browser.<li>
<p>Note that it is good practice to use both the opening and closing tags, even if the closing tag
may not be strictly necessary. Be sure that your document has the DOCTYPE tag, and that it
uses proper html and body tags, each with both opening and closing tags. If your assignment is
done properly, you should see the heading, subheading, a paragraph, an ordered list, and then
another paragraph, all displayed properly with no errors. Send in your document for grading.
